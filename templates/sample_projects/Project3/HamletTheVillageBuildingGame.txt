Hamlet The Village Building Game

Grow a humble Hamlet into a bustling Town. A new game by David Chircop.
A Hamlet in British English is a small village without a church.
Hamlet is a medium weight competitive village builder where players are communally turning their hamlet into a bustling little town, by completing the construction of the church.
Hamlet features irregular shaped tiles that connect together without a grid to form a village that is completely different every time. 
The tile placement organically creates interconnecting paths that the villagers use to access buildings.
