Motor City: A strategic engine-building roll and write game!

Motor City: Oversee engineering, assembly, and more to run an automotive empire in this strategic roll and write game! Launches March 8
MotorCity is a stunningly-illustrated roll-and-write game about running an auto plant in the heyday of Detroit for 1 to 4 players that plays in about 45 minutes. 
In Motor City, you’re the supervisor at a plant during the heyday of Detroit’s automotive industry, when big engines and horsepower ruled the day. You’ve just been put in charge of day-to-day operations across the entire facility. You’ll need a clipboard, steel-toed boots, and an even steelier eye for efficiency.
