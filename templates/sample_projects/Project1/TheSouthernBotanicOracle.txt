The Southern Botanic Oracle

A botanical oracle deck drawn from ancestral traditions of the American South. 45 stunning illustrated cards with a full booklet.
The Southern Botanic Oracle is the second oracle deck by me, Stacey Williams-Ng. This will be a large-format deck celebrating the roots, herbs, flowers and trees of the American South. I am so pleased and honored to be able to make this card deck.
